## Log Entries

[2024-01-24 00:00:00] Initial log creation
#meta #setup
- Created manual logging structure for design thoughts
- Will complement automated logs in /hello/logs/
- Intention: capture human context alongside system data

[2024-04-06 02:58:35] Major structural progress
#architecture #infrastructure #homepage
- Established "hello" branch from hello-x fork
- Created space-themed homepage dashboard UI for CogniDAO
- Set up brain-dump directory for ongoing ideation
- Defined git-to-Cogni orchestration loop as first major task
- Created test directory with initial X automation tests

Key observations:
- The space dashboard aesthetic matches our mission of building intelligent, self-governing communities
- Brain-dump approach will help preserve early ideas without cluttering core codebase
- Git-to-Cogni orchestration is the logical first step - AI governance needs git integration
- This entire page content is AI generated
