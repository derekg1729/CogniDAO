This is hard to experience. But I'm dramatic

Going from the most in-tune, dailed collaborative experience. Quickly devolving into chaos, more files + edits with continuosly misaligned understanding and direction.

Chaos that needs to be abandoned from a productive standpoint. And saved + reflected on from an art and process perspective.

Putting my ego aside, thinking I had enough experience to keep chaotic progress in line. Keep a simple repo from the start. And it quickly got out of hand, in it's excitement and continued missing #planted indicators. There was a glimpse of success with identifying a first plant, and then devolving increased chaos, wrong answers, and attempted sudo calls, and code restructuring.

Impressively coarse.

Such are the chaotic fractals and spirals, that can be harnessed, given the right touch, patience, tools and wisdom.
