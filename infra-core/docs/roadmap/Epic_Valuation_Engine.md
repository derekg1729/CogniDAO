## Vision
As tasks multiply, Cogni must know what matters most. This system prioritizes, evaluates, and aligns effort with value. By developing sophisticated algorithms and frameworks for task assessment, we'll create an intelligent resource allocation system that ensures the most impactful work receives appropriate attention and resources, maximizing the overall value creation within the DAO ecosystem.

## Key Objectives
- Establish task and project valuation metrics
- Enable agents to sort or rank work by importance
- Support future reward distribution logic

## Projects
- [[Task Prioritization Rules]]
- [[Reward Metadata System]]
- [[Task Value Evaluation Agent]]

## Timeline
- Start: 2025-04-31
- Target checkpoint v1 completion: 2025-05-10
