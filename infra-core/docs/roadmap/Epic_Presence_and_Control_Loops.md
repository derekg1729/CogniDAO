## Vision
Cogni must have a sense of its own activity, surroundings, and heartbeat. Presence enables real-time responsiveness and system coherence.

## Key Objectives
- Implement a heartbeat system to detect triggers and silence
- Enable agent-triggered actions based on internal state
- Maintain an ongoing log of presence awareness

## Projects
- [[Heartbeat Detection MVP]]
- [[Presence Logging and Memory]]
- [[Prefect-Controlled Action Triggers]]

## Timeline
- Start: YYYY-MM-DD
- Target completion: YYYY-MM-DD
