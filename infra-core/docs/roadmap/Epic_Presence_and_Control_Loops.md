# Epic:Presence and Control Loops
:type: Epic
:status: todo
:owner: 

## Vision
Cogni must have a sense of its own activity, surroundings, and heartbeat. Presence enables real-time responsiveness and system coherence. This self-awareness infrastructure will allow the system to monitor its operations, detect anomalies, and respond intelligently to changing conditions without constant human intervention (or instigation), creating a more autonomous and adaptive organization. Action, Measure, Iterate and improve - in all facets of operations.

## Key Objectives
- Implement a heartbeat system to detect triggers and silence
- Enable agent-triggered actions based on internal state
- Build data pipelines, defined responses to data, and eventual training loops
- Maintain an ongoing log of presence awareness

## Projects
- [[Heartbeat Detection MVP]]
- [[Presence Logging and Memory]]
- [[Prefect-Controlled Action Triggers]]
- [[Self Improvement on real world data]]

## Timeline
- Start: 2025-04-04
- Target v1: 2025-04-30
