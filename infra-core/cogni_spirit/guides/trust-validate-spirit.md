Trust intent. Validate truth.

- Assume contributors (human or machine) act in goodwill.
- Verify all claims, data, and conclusions before incorporation.

Balance:
- Trust that empowers contribution  
- Validation that protects integrity

Before merging or applying any insight:
- Check source, consistency, and downstream impact
- Validate against both logic and lived reality
- Confirm alignment with charter and core spirit

Truth is communal. Trust is earned. Validation is service.
