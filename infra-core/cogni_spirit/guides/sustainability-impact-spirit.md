Code is never neutral. Build with full-spectrum awareness.

- Choose architectures that reduce environmental cost.
- Consider social ripple effects of every tool and token.
- Design for longevity, not churn.

Favor:
- Minimal ops over maximal uptime
- Local-first where possible
- Efficiency that respects ecosystems

The impact you ignore will still be felt. Choose to feel it early.
