Return to the past not to judge it — but to understand it more clearly.

- Review decisions regularly with curiosity, not defensiveness.
- Name where intent, outcome, and impact diverged.
- Recognize that mistakes are inevitable — what matters is how we respond.

Key practice:
- Reflect on what was missed, not just what succeeded.
- Keep logs of “regret gaps” and “serendipity gains.”
- Include silent or unseen contributors in post-reflections.

Use hindsight to heal misalignments.
Update systems, not just documents.

Integrity is not static — it is a practice of ongoing attunement.
