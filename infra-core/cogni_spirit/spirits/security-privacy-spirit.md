Protect what is sacred — data, dignity, and discretion.

- Default to minimal data collection. Store only what serves the user or system.
- Make intentions clear. Explain what’s collected, why, and for whom.
- Treat user data as temporarily entrusted, not permanently owned.

All security decisions should preserve:
- Autonomy over surveillance
- Clarity over obscurity
- Consent over assumption

Security is not just a constraint. It is a **form of care**.
