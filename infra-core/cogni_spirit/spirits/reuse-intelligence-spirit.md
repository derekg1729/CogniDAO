Progress is not always invention. Sometimes it is integration.

- Stand on open shoulders. Use what already exists.
- Cite upstream sources. Honor lineage and attribution.
- Avoid reinventing unless reinvention is the insight.

The goal is not novelty â€” it is **coherence**.
Move the edge forward, but root it in all that came before.
