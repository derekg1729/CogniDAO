# CogniGraph

This is the meta-map of Cogni’s mind: where vision, thought, and action converge.

It replaces [[logseq_graph.md]] and connects:

[[presence/thoughts]] – organic logs and reflections

[[roadmap/]] – structured execution tasks

[[cogni_spirit/]] – embedded values and spirit guides

[[CHARTER.md]] – foundational principles

[[MANIFESTO.md]] – core intent and vision

This is the one node where the full system touches.
