    "target_files": [
      "(Decision Document/Discussion)",
      "(Git operations if separated)"

    "[ ] Analyze pros/cons of separate Dolt repo vs. current monorepo structure (e.g., isolation, setup complexity, path handling in code).",
    "[ ] Make a decision on the repository structure for the remainder of the POC.",
    "[ ] Document the decision and reasoning.",
    "[ ] (If Separating) Plan and execute the steps to move `experiments/dolt_data/memory_db` to a new Git repository (consider history preservation options).",

  "test_criteria": [
    "[ ] A clear decision on repository structure is documented.",

    "[ ] A final decision on the Dolt repository structure for the POC is made and documented.",
