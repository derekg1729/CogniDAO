    "target_file": "experiments/scripts/run_basic_agent.py",
    "test_file": "experiments/tests/test_basic_agent_integration.py",
    "dependencies": [
      "CogniStructuredMemoryAdapter (from Task 3.2)",
      "StructuredMemoryBank (instantiated, from Task 3.1)",
      "LangChain agent setup (basic structure, LLM, prompt)"
    ]
  },
  "action_items": [
    "[x] Create a script (`run_basic_agent.py`) to set up and run the agent.",
    "[x] Instantiate `StructuredMemoryBank` with necessary configs (Dolt/LlamaIndex paths).",
    "[x] Instantiate `CogniStructuredMemoryAdapter`, passing the `StructuredMemoryBank` instance.",
    "[x] Define a simple LangChain prompt template that includes the memory variable key (e.g., `{relevant_blocks}`).",
    "[x] Configure a LangChain LLM (e.g., `ChatOpenAI`).",
    "[x] Create a LangChain agent/chain (e.g., using LCEL or `AgentExecutor`) that incorporates the LLM, prompt, and the `CogniStructuredMemoryAdapter` instance.",
    "[x] Add logic to the script to invoke the agent with sample input.",
    "[x] Ensure the agent's execution flow correctly calls `load_memory_variables` and potentially `save_context`."
  ],
  "test_criteria": [
    "[x] Running the script executes the agent without errors.",
    "[x] With relevant blocks pre-seeded in memory, invoking the agent with related input shows the memory content being included in the prompt/context sent to the LLM (verify via LangChain debug/verbose output).",
    "[x] After the agent runs, check if a new memory block representing the interaction was created via `save_context` (verify by querying `StructuredMemoryBank` or checking Dolt)."
  ],
  "success_criteria": [
    "[x] A basic LangChain agent successfully uses `CogniStructuredMemoryAdapter` for context retrieval.",
    "[x] The agent can potentially save interaction context back into structured memory.",
    "[x] The integration demonstrates the adapter working within the LangChain ecosystem."
  ],
  "current_status": "Task completed. Implemented run_basic_agent.py that successfully integrates StructuredMemoryBank and CogniStructuredMemoryAdapter with a LangChain chain. Fixed linter errors and runtime issues with save_tags handling. Demonstrated successful memory retrieval and saving with persistent storage in Dolt DB and semantic indexing via LlamaIndex. The agent can now query existing memories and persist new interactions, ensuring a coherent memory system across sessions."
