  "goal": "Create a traceable link between a specific MemoryBlock version and the Dolt commit it was part of.",
  "action_items": [
    "[ ] Define a new Dolt table `block_proofs` with columns like `block_id` (TEXT, FOREIGN KEY to `memory_blocks.id`), `commit_hash` (TEXT), `write_timestamp` (DATETIME).",
    "[ ] Consider a PRIMARY KEY (e.g., on `block_id` and `commit_hash` or a separate proof ID).",
    "[ ] Commit the new table schema (`dolt add .`, `dolt commit -m 'Create block_proofs table'`).",
    "[ ] Modify the Dolt writing functions (from Task 5.1) to insert a new row into `block_proofs` after retrieving the commit hash (from Task 7.1).",
    "[ ] Ensure the correct `block_id` and `commit_hash` are inserted."

  "test_criteria": [
    "Trigger a MemoryBlock save/update.",
    "Verify a new row is added to the `block_proofs` table.",
    "Verify the `block_id` matches the saved/updated block and the `commit_hash` matches the hash retrieved in Task 7.1."
