  "phase": "ðŸ§ª Optional Debugging + Inspection",
  "goal": "Visualize the memory blocks and their connections as an interactive graph in the UI.",
  "action_items": [
    "[ ] Add `cytoscape.js` library to the frontend project.",
    "[ ] Create a new page or component in the frontend for the graph view.",
    "[ ] Fetch the graph data from the `/api/graph` endpoint (Task 6.3).",
    "[ ] Initialize a Cytoscape instance with the fetched node and edge data.",
    "[ ] Configure basic layout (e.g., `cose`, `breadthfirst`).",
    "[ ] Apply basic styling (e.g., different colors/shapes for nodes based on `type`).",
    "[ ] Add basic interactivity (e.g., panning, zooming)."

  "test_criteria": [
    "Navigate to the graph viewer page in the frontend UI.",
    "Verify that a graph is rendered.",
    "Verify that nodes and edges correspond to the memory blocks and links in Dolt.",
    "Verify basic interactivity (pan, zoom) works.",
    "Verify nodes are styled differently based on their type."
