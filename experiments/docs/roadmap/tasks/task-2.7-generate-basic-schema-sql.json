  "type": "Task",
  "status": "completed",
  "project": "CogniMemorySystem-POC",
  "name": "Generate Basic Dolt SQL Schema from MemoryBlock Definition",
  "phase": "ðŸ§  Indexing + Retrieval (LlamaIndex)",
  "description": "Turn the `generate_dolt_schema.py` placeholder into a minimally useful script that outputs a hardcoded (or partially mapped) `schema.sql` file using known MemoryBlock structure. This serves as a stand-in until full dynamic Pydantic-to-SQL generation is implemented.",
  "goal": "Ensure schema.sql is always generated from a single source of truth and not manually edited.",
  "implementation_details": {
    "target_script": "experiments/scripts/generate_dolt_schema.py",
    "output_file": "experiments/dolt_data/schema.sql",
    "models_used": ["MemoryBlock (from memory_block.py)"],
    "field_mappings": "Use hardcoded or lightly templated mapping for MVP (e.g., `str -> TEXT`, `datetime -> DATETIME`, `List[str] -> JSON`)"
  },
  "action_items": [
    "[x] Define a manual SQL template based on current MemoryBlock fields.",
    "[x] Write this template to `schema.sql` when script is run.",
    "[x] (Optional) Add a comment at the top of the generated file: `-- Auto-generated from MemoryBlock schema. Do not edit manually.`",
    "[x] Confirm the script succeeds when run with no arguments.",
    "[x] Document in README or dev docs that schema.sql is generated, not hand-written."
  ],
  "test_criteria": [
    "[x] Running `python generate_dolt_schema.py` creates a valid `schema.sql` file in the dolt_data folder.",
    "[x] `schema.sql` contains a `CREATE TABLE memory_blocks (...)` with all known MVP fields from `MemoryBlock`.",
    "[x] File includes a comment noting it is auto-generated."
  ],
  "validation": {
    "executed_steps": [
      "[x] Deleted schema.sql file and ran the script to confirm it gets recreated properly",
      "[x] Verified script runs without errors",
      "[x] Confirmed generated schema contains all three required tables: memory_blocks, block_links, and node_schemas",
      "[x] Validated that all fields from MemoryBlock are properly included in the schema",
      "[x] Ensured SQL syntax is correct and follows the Dolt schema conventions"
    ],
    "results": "Schema generation script works reliably. The schema.sql file is successfully recreated with all required tables and fields when the script is run, even if the file was previously deleted."
  },
  "success_criteria": [
    "[x] The `schema.sql` used in the Dolt repo is fully generated from this script.",
    "[x] Developers and agents do not manually modify schema.sql.",
    "[x] The MemoryBlock structure and Dolt table definition stay in sync."
  ],
  "current_status": "Task completed. Implemented generate_dolt_schema.py script that generates a complete schema.sql file with properly defined tables for memory_blocks, block_links, and node_schemas. The script adds appropriate comments and handles all fields from the MemoryBlock model."
