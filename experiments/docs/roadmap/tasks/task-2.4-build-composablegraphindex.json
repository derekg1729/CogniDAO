  "phase": "ðŸ§  Indexing + Retrieval (LlamaIndex)",
  "goal": "Allow graph traversal and type-aware query expansion based on block links.",
  "action_items": [
    "[ ] Ensure `memory_block_to_node` (Task 2.4) correctly populates Node `relationships` or metadata for links.",
    "[ ] Create a list of `Node` objects representing sample linked blocks (e.g., a project node linked to task nodes).",
    "[ ] Instantiate a LlamaIndex `ComposableGraph` or `KnowledgeGraphIndex`.",
    "[ ] Add the Nodes (with their relationship info) to the graph index.",
    "[ ] Write a sample query that utilizes graph traversal (e.g., 'Find all tasks related to project X').",
    "[ ] Research LlamaIndex methods for graph traversal querying (`graph.query`, `graph.get_related_nodes`, etc.)."
  ],
  "test_criteria": [
    "Execute a graph traversal query.",
    "Verify that the query correctly returns nodes based on the defined relationships (e.g., traversing from a project node returns its linked task nodes)."
