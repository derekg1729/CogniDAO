  "phase": "Link‑First Graph Layer",
  "description": "Create a scalable, generic LinkManager for the `block_links` table and a thin domain helper for ExecutableMetadata blocks (task / project / epic / bug). The manager must enforce referential‑integrity, prevent cycles, expose fast graph queries, and provide core link operations. A mix‑in helper (`pm_executable_links.py`) should add ergonomic APIs such as `add_blocker`, `get_blockers`, `ready_tasks`, etc., without duplicating storage logic.",

  "current_status": "Task is making significant progress. Created and implemented a domain-separated relation_registry.py that organizes relation types by category (core, project_management, bug_tracking, knowledge) with proper Enum classes, helper functions, and bidirectional relation mappings. All tests for the relation registry are passing. Updated schemas/common.py to import RelationType from the registry. All existing LinkManager, LinkQuery, and BlockLink tests remain passing. The next step is to implement the ExecutableLinkManager helper layer specifically for project management operations."
