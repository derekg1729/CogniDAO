  "phase": "Link‑First Graph Layer",
  "description": "Create a scalable, generic LinkManager for the `block_links` table and a thin domain helper for ExecutableMetadata blocks (task / project / epic / bug). The manager must enforce referential‑integrity, prevent cycles, expose fast graph queries, and provide core link operations. A mix‑in helper (`pm_executable_links.py`) should add ergonomic APIs such as `add_blocker`, `get_blockers`, `ready_tasks`, etc., without duplicating storage logic.",
