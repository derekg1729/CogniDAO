  "action_items": [
    "[x] Create `sync_dolt_to_llamaindex.py` script.",
    "[x] Import necessary modules: `dolt_reader`, `LlamaMemory`, `argparse` (for DB path).",
    "[x] Implement main execution block (`if __name__ == '__main__':`).",
    "[x] Add argument parsing for Dolt DB path and LlamaIndex storage path.",
    "[x] Initialize `LlamaMemory` instance with the specified path.",
    "[x] Call `dolt_reader.read_memory_blocks` to retrieve blocks from Dolt.",
    "[x] Loop through the retrieved `MemoryBlock` objects.",
    "[x] For each block, call `llama_memory.add_block(block)` to index it.",
    "[x] Add logging to indicate progress and completion.",
    "[x] Consider adding logic to handle potential errors during indexing of individual blocks.",
    "[x] Write integration tests:",
    "[x]   Setup: Create test Dolt DB, add sample blocks (including one with links).",
    "[x]   Execute: Run the `sync_dolt_to_llamaindex.py` script against the test DB and a temporary LlamaIndex path.",
    "[x]   Verify: Query the resulting LlamaIndex stores (vector and graph) to confirm blocks and relationships were indexed correctly."
  ],
  "test_criteria": [
    "[x] Integration test successfully indexes blocks from a test Dolt DB into LlamaIndex.",
    "[x] Test verifies that vector queries return the indexed blocks.",
    "[x] Test verifies that graph relationships (using `get_rel_map` or `get_backlinks`) match the links defined in the Dolt data.",
    "[x] Script runs without errors on valid input."
  ],
  "success_criteria": [
    "[x] A script exists that can synchronize `MemoryBlock` data from Dolt into the LlamaIndex system.",
    "[x] Both vector embeddings and graph relationships are correctly indexed in LlamaIndex based on the Dolt source data."
  ],
  "current_status": "Task complete. Created sync_dolt_to_llamaindex.py script that retrieves MemoryBlocks from Dolt and indexes them into LlamaIndex. Implementation includes proper error handling, logging, and command-line arguments. Added comprehensive tests in test_sync_dolt_to_llamaindex.py to verify both vector embeddings and graph relationships are correctly preserved."
