  "phase": "üåê Frontend + API Hookup",
  "goal": "Allow users to see the source memory blocks used by the agent to generate its response.",
  "action_items": [
    "[ ] Modify the `/api/chat` endpoint (Task 4.1) or the agent logic (Phase 3) to capture the source nodes/blocks retrieved by the `QueryMemoryBlocks` tool.",
    "[ ] Determine how to send this source information to the frontend:",
    "[ ] Option A: Send as separate metadata alongside the streaming response (e.g., using Vercel AI SDK data messages or custom SSE events).",
    "[ ] Option B: Include citations or summaries within the streamed response text itself.",
    "[ ] Modify the frontend (Task 4.2) to receive and display this source information.",
    "[ ] Add a UI element (e.g., a small citation link, an expandable section below the message) to show the retrieved block(s)."
  ],
  "test_criteria": [
    "Send a query via the frontend UI that triggers memory retrieval (e.g., 'What is CogniDAO?').",
    "Verify the agent's response appears.",
    "Verify that information about the source MemoryBlock(s) used is displayed alongside or linked from the agent's response in the UI."
