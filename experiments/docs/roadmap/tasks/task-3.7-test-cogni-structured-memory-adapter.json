  "action_items": [
    "[x] Set up pytest fixtures.",
    "[x] Create a mock `StructuredMemoryBank` instance using `unittest.mock.MagicMock`.",
    "[x] Configure mock return values for methods like `query_semantic` and mock expectations for `create_memory_block`.",
    "[x] Instantiate `CogniStructuredMemoryAdapter` with the mocked bank.",
    "[x] Test `load_memory_variables`:",
    "[x]   Call the method with sample input.",
    "[x]   Assert that the mock `query_semantic` was called with the correct arguments.",
    "[x]   Assert that the returned dictionary has the expected structure and contains the formatted mock results.",
    "[x] Test `save_context`:",
    "[x]   Call the method with sample inputs and outputs.",
    "[x]   Assert that the mock `create_memory_block` was called.",
    "[x]   Assert that the `MemoryBlock` object passed to `create_memory_block` has the expected text, type, and tags based on the inputs/outputs.",
    "[ ] Test `memory_variables` property returns the expected list of keys.",
    "[ ] Test `clear` method (if implemented, test its behavior; otherwise, test that it raises `NotImplementedError` or logs appropriately)."
  ],
  "test_criteria": [
    "[ ] All defined tests pass.",
    "[ ] Tests verify the adapter correctly calls the underlying `StructuredMemoryBank` methods.",
    "[ ] Tests verify the adapter correctly formats data for LangChain compatibility (`load_memory_variables`).",
    "[ ] Tests verify the adapter correctly constructs `MemoryBlock` objects (`save_context`)."
  ],
  "success_criteria": [
    "[ ] High test coverage for `CogniStructuredMemoryAdapter`.",
    "[ ] Confidence that the adapter functions correctly as a bridge between LangChain and `StructuredMemoryBank`."
  ],
  "current_status": "Test file test_langchain_adapter.py created. Initial tests for load_memory_variables and save_context (success and missing input cases) added and passing after schema fix. Next steps: Add tests for memory_variables property and clear method."
