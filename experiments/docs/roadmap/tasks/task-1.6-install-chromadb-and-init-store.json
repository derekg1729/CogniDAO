  "action_items": [
    "[x] Add `chromadb` package to dependencies. - Verified via import test",
    "[x] Write a script/function to initialize a persistent ChromaDB client at the designated path (e.g., `./storage/chroma`). - Implemented within LlamaMemory class",
    "[x] Confirm the storage directory is created and ChromaDB can connect. - Verified by running LlamaMemory initialization"
  ],
  "test_criteria": [
    "Successful import of `chromadb`. - Verified",
    "Persistent ChromaDB store initialized without errors. - Verified via LlamaMemory init",
    "Ability to connect to the initialized store. - Verified via LlamaMemory init"
  ],
  "current_status": "ChromaDB installation verified. Initialization logic integrated into LlamaMemory class (__init__) which successfully connects to persistent storage at ./storage/chroma and sets up LlamaIndex ChromaVectorStore."
