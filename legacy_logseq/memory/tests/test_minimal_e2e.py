"""
True Minimal E2E tests for CogniMemoryClient.

These tests demonstrate the core memory pipeline functionality:
1. Load a single file (charter.md), index it, and query for charter content
2. Scan Logseq database for #thought tags, index them, and query

Purpose:
- Verify the complete pipeline functions without mocks
- Test with real embedding generation
- Validate tag filtering works correctly
- Ensure search results are relevant to queries
- Check for result deduplication

These tests follow Cogni's core principles:
- Clarity over control: Simple, focused tests that verify core functionality
- Meaning over motion: Real content extraction and search, not just API testing
- Simplicity over scale: Minimal test cases that demonstrate the full pipeline
