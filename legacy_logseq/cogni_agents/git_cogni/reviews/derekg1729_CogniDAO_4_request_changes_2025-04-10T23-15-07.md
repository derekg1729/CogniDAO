## final_verdict
# Final Verdict on PR #4 in derekg1729/CogniDAO

## Summary of Changes
This pull request introduces the MVP of `git-cogni`, a tool designed to automate the code review process within the CogniDAO project. The changes include the design files for the MVP, refactoring of existing code for better organization, the implementation of `git-cogni` workflow with tests, and the creation of a CLI tool for `git-cogni`. The PR also includes several thoughts and task updates.

## Consistent Issues
A few issues were consistently found across the commits:
1. **Commit Message Alignment**: Some commit messages were vague or misleading, not accurately reflecting the changes made.
2. **Mixed Changes**: Several commits included unrelated changes, making it difficult to understand the purpose of the commit.
3. **Lack of Tests**: Some commits introduced new features or significant changes without corresponding tests.

## Recommendations for Improvement
1. **Improve Commit Messages**: Commit messages should accurately reflect the changes made. Avoid vague language and ensure the message provides a clear summary of the commit.
2. **Separate Unrelated Changes**: Each commit should focus on a single logical change. Avoid mixing unrelated changes in a single commit.
3. **Include Tests**: All non-trivial code changes should include corresponding tests. If tests are deferred, the commit should be explicitly marked and justified.

## Final Decision
`REQUEST_CHANGES`

While the PR introduces valuable features and improvements, the issues identified above need to be addressed before approval. Specifically, commit messages should be improved for clarity, unrelated changes should be separated into different commits, and all significant code changes should include tests.
