## final_verdict
# Final Verdict on PR #4 in derekg1729/CogniDAO

## Summary of Changes
This pull request contains a series of commits that contribute to the development of the `git-cogni` MVP. The changes include the addition of design files, refactoring of existing code, renaming of directories, and updates to documentation. There are also several commits marked as work-in-progress (WIP) that introduce new features and refactor existing code to simplify the system.

## Consistent Issues
Several commits lack corresponding tests, which violates the core directive that untested code is untrusted code. Additionally, a few commits have vague or misleading commit messages that do not accurately reflect the changes made. There are also instances where unrelated changes are mixed in a single commit, making it difficult to understand the purpose and impact of each change.

## Recommendations for Improvement
1. **Include Corresponding Tests**: Ensure that all non-trivial code changes are accompanied by corresponding tests. If tests are deferred, the commit must be explicitly marked and justified.
2. **Improve Commit Messages**: Make sure that commit messages are clear, specific, and accurately describe the changes made. Avoid vague language and misleading summaries.
3. **Separate Unrelated Changes**: Break down large commits into smaller, focused ones. Do not mix unrelated changes in a single commit.

## Final Decision
`REQUEST_CHANGES`

While the pull request contributes significantly to the development of the `git-cogni` MVP, there are several issues that need to be addressed before it can be approved. Specifically, the lack of corresponding tests for several commits and the need for improved commit messages and separation of unrelated changes.
