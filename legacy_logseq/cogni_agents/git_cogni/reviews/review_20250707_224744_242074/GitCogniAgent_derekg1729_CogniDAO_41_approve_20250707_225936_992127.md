### Commit e3d7642: fix(playwright graph): Fix agent message handling by simplifying state structure

- Fix PlaywrightAgentState: remove extra fields causing user input to go to current_task instead of messages array
- Fix MCP connection: correct Playwright server port from 58462 to 24162 in docker-compose and mcp_client
- Refactor playwright_poc to match cogni_presence structure exactly:
  * Simplify agent.py: use get_mcp_tools_with_refresh() and remove complex setup
  * Standardize graph.py: change 'tools' node to 'action' for consistency
  * Update should_continue(): remove empty messages check to match cogni_presence
- Update tests: remove references to deprecated state fields
- Clean up dependencies: remove duplicate dev-dependencies in uv.lock

Resolves: User messages now properly flow to agent instead of being stored in current_task field
Result: Playwright agent responds to messages and provides full browser automation capabilities
