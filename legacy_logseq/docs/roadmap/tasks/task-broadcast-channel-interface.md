## Description
Implement the base channel interface that defines the contract for all broadcast channel implementations in BroadcastCogni.

## Action Items
- [ ] Define abstract base class for broadcast channels
- [ ] Implement required interface methods
- [ ] Document interface requirements
- [ ] Create unit tests for interface conformance
- [ ] Implement channel registration mechanism

## Implementation Details
- Interface should define the following methods:
  - `authenticate()` - Authentication with channel API
  - `validate_content()` - Content validation against channel requirements
  - `publish()` - Publishing content to the channel
  - `get_status()` - Retrieving status of published content
- Use Python's ABC (Abstract Base Class) module
- Implement proper type hints
- Include comprehensive docstrings

## Success Criteria
- Interface clearly defines the contract for all channels
- Documentation provides clear implementation guidance
- Interface is extensible for future channel additions
- Unit tests verify interface conformance
- Registration mechanism allows dynamic channel discovery

## Estimated Effort
- Hours: 2-3
