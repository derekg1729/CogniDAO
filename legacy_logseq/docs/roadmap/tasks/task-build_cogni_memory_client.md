# Task:[Build Cogni Memory Client]
:type: Task
:status: completed
:project: [project-cogni_memory_architecture]
:owner: 

## Current Status
The CogniMemoryClient has been fully implemented with a unified interface for memory operations. The implementation includes:
- `memory_client.py` with the CogniMemoryClient class providing query, save, and archive functionality
- `memory_tool.py` providing a simple function-based interface for agent integration
- Comprehensive tests in `test_memory_client.py` with 100% pass rate
- Error handling for edge cases and graceful fallbacks

## Description
Create a unified CogniMemoryClient interface that provides consistent access to memory operations (query, save, archive) across the memory system, enabling integration with agent workflows.

## Action Items
- [x] Define Pydantic schema models for memory records
- [x] Implement unified query interface with semantic search
- [x] Create memory writing/saving interfaces
- [x] Add archive operations to move content to cold storage
- [x] Implement version handling for memory schema
- [x] Create simple utility for testing memory operations

## Deliverables
1. A `schema.py` module with:
   - Pydantic models for memory blocks
   - Query and response models
   - Schema versioning

2. A unified query interface that supports:
   - Searching across both hot and cold storage
   - Filtering by tags and relevance
   - Proper error handling

3. A unified `CogniMemoryClient` class that provides:
   - Simplified memory operations (query, save, archive)
   - Consistent interface for all memory interactions
   - Integration hooks for agent workflows

4. A simple `memory_tool.py` utility for integrating with agent frameworks

## Test Criteria
- [x] Test end-to-end memory operations:
```python
def test_memory_client():
    # Initialize client with test storage
    client = CogniMemoryClient(
        chroma_path="./test_chroma",
        archive_path="./test_archive"
    )
    
    # Save new memory blocks
    blocks = [create_test_memory_block() for _ in range(3)]
    client.save_blocks(blocks)
    
    # Query memories
    results = client.query("test memory", n_results=2)
    assert len(results.blocks) > 0
    
    # Archive memories
    client.archive_blocks(blocks)
    
    # Query across both hot and cold storage
    results = client.query("test memory", include_archived=True)
    assert len(results.blocks) > 0
```

- [x] Test memory schema validation:
```python
def test_schema_validation():
    # Test valid block
    valid_block = MemoryBlock(
        text="Valid block",
        tags=["#thought"],
        source_file="test.md"
    )
    
    # This should work fine
    valid_json = valid_block.model_dump_json()
    
    # Test with missing required field
    with pytest.raises(Exception):
        invalid_block = MemoryBlock(
            tags=["#thought"],
            source_file="test.md"
        )
```

- [x] Test memory tool integration:
```python
def test_memory_tool():
    result = memory_tool(
        input_text="test memory",
        n_results=3
    )
    
    assert isinstance(result, dict)
    assert "query" in result
    assert "results" in result
    assert "result_count" in result
```

- [x] Verify version compatibility handling
- [x] Test integration with both hot and cold storage
- [x] Validate error handling in client operations

## Implementation Details
- `CogniMemoryClient` implemented in `memory_client.py` with proper error handling and integration with both storage systems
- All main operations (query, save, archive) are supported with a clean interface
- `memory_tool.py` provides a simplified function-based API for agent integration
- Tests in `test_memory_client.py` validate all functionality with 100% pass rate
- ChromaDB initialization improved to handle cases where collection doesn't exist
- Exception handling added for robust operation even when components fail

## Notes
- Design follows agent interoperability principles
- Ready for integration with MCP or Agent2Agent SDK
- Clean, typed interface with proper error handling
- Successfully implemented memory_tool.py for quick integration with agent frameworks

## Dependencies
- ChromaDB integration from task-save_vector_db_records
- JSON archive format from task-create_memory_index_json
- Pydantic for schema enforcement
