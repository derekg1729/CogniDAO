# Task: Implement LangChain Integration for GitCogni
:type: Task
:status: deprioritized
:project: [[project-git-cogni-agent]]
:owner:

## Description
Create Git-specific LangChain prompts and output parsers for commit review.

## Action Items
- [ ] Adapt specialized commit review prompt (ai-review-process.v1.1.md) template with git-specific context
- [ ] Create structured output schema for review results (summary, issues, suggestions)
- [ ] Implement custom output parser for standardized review format
- [ ] Create final summarization chain for PR review decision

## Notes
For the MVP, we decided to use direct OpenAI integration instead of LangChain:

1. **Direct OpenAI Integration**: We implemented this simpler approach for the MVP, which directly calls the OpenAI API with properly formatted prompts. This has been completed and successfully tested with real PR reviews.

2. **Full LangChain Integration**: This more robust approach remains as a potential future enhancement if needed for more complex integration or enhanced capabilities.

The direct OpenAI approach has proven effective for the current use case, so this task has been deprioritized. We may revisit LangChain integration in the future if we need more complex prompt chains or specialized output parsing.

## Estimated Effort
- Hours: 3-4 (estimated)

## Dependencies
- Python environment with required packages installed
- Completed spirit guide implementation (âœ“)
