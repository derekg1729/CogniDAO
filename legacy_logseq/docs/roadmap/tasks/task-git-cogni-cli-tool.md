# Task: Refactor GitCogni CLI and Flow for Consistency
:type: Task
:status: completed
:project: [[project-git-cogni-agent]]
:owner:

## Description
Refactor the GitCogni CLI tool and Prefect Flow to share implementation, minimizing code duplication and ensuring consistent behavior.

## Action Items
- [x] Move logging setup from CLI to GitCogniAgent class
- [x] Create standardized verdict extraction helper in GitCogniAgent
- [x] Move monitoring/instrumentation into core agent class
- [x] Refactor CLI as thin wrapper around agent methods
- [x] Ensure Flow uses the same agent methods as CLI
- [x] Add tests for shared functionality
- [x] Document unified approach for future enhancements
- [x] Remove duplicate logging from CLI

## Notes
The refactoring has been completed with the following improvements:

1. Centralized logging setup in GitCogniAgent.setup_logging()
2. Added get_verdict_from_text() and monitor_token_usage() helpers to GitCogniAgent
3. Integrated token usage monitoring into review_pr() method
4. Simplified CLI to be a thin wrapper around agent methods
5. Updated Prefect Flow to use the same verdict extraction method
6. Added tests for the CLI tool
7. Ensured consistent behavior across CLI and Flow interfaces
8. Removed duplicate logging from CLI to make it a truly thin wrapper

The unified approach ensures that all functionality, logging, monitoring, and error handling are handled consistently regardless of whether GitCogni is invoked via CLI or Prefect Flow. This will make future maintenance and enhancements much easier.

## Estimated Effort
- Hours: 4 (actual)

## Dependencies
- Completed GitCogniAgent implementation (✓)
- Completed Prefect flow (✓)
