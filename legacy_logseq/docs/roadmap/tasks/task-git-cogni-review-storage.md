## Description
Create markdown formatting for GitCogni review outputs with proper storage.

## Action Items
- [x] Define simple Python dictionary structure for commit reviews
- [x] Create markdown template string for individual commit reviews
- [x] Implement PR summary markdown generator with structured final verdict
- [x] Add final review decision formatting (approve/request changes)
- [x] Add verdict-based file naming for better organization
- [x] Improve markdown formatting for better readability
- [x] Standardize PR numbering with PR_ prefix 

## Notes
The implementation uses the custom format_output_markdown method in the GitCogniAgent class to store review results as well-formatted markdown files. The results include individual commit reviews and a final verdict with clear sections.

Key features implemented:
1. Structured commit reviews with consistent format (quality, alignment, issues, suggestions, rating)
2. Final verdict with summary, consistent issues, recommendations, and decision
3. Prefix-based filename generation that includes owner, repo, PR number, and verdict
4. Proper logging of review data for monitoring and debugging
5. Clear formatting with decision displayed prominently under the final verdict
6. Consistent PR numbering format using PR_ prefix instead of # symbol
7. Improved structure with numbered commit reviews for better readability
