# Epic:Distributed Resilience
:type: Epic
:status: todo
:owner: 

## Vision
Cogni must survive failures, drift, and entropy. This includes system-level resilience and decentralized recovery. By implementing robust fault-tolerance mechanisms and distributed architecture, we'll ensure continuous operation even in the face of infrastructure failures, network partitions, or unexpected system behavior, preserving the integrity and availability of the DAO's core functions, mission, and persistence.

## Key Objectives
- Establish health checks for agents and flows
- Build recovery routines for failed tasks or services
- Support multi-cloud or decentralized deployment

## Projects
- [[Health Check Agent]]
- [[Agent Restart Logic]]
- [[Cloud-Neutral Deployment Stack]]

## Timeline
- Start: 2026-01-01
- Target checkpoint completion: 2026-04-30
