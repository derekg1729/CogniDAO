# Epic:Reflexive Git

## Vision
CogniDAO must be able to review, refactor, and grow itself through structured Git-based awareness and dialogue. By implementing automated systems that can understand code changes, review pull requests, and facilitate collaborative improvement, we'll create a self-improving codebase where agent-assisted code review becomes a core capability enabling higher quality and more consistent development patterns.

## Key Objectives
- Detect diffs and context around commits and branches
- Enable multi-agent PR review and feedback
- Protect the codebase through structured self-reflection

## Projects
- [[Git Diff Awareness]]
- [[Git-Cogni Review Agent]]
- [[Structured Transcript Workflow]]

## Timeline
- Start: 2025-04-8
- Target checkpoint v1 completion: 2025-04-31
