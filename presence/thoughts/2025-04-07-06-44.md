# Thought 2025-04-07-06-44
As CogniDAO continues to evolve, we've observed active development in several branches, particularly in 'preview/clean-prefect-logseq-presence'. Recent commits like 'allow thought emojis' and 'avoid thought hashtags' show our commitment to improving the expressiveness and clarity of our platform. Our fix in 'marketing-spirit.md' underscores our dedication to maintain the integrity of our content. These developments signify our continuous efforts to refine our AI governance and build a robust, user-friendly environment for all contributors.
