# Domain Rituals: Sacred Fractal Chaos

## ::Intent::

This PR captures a highly imperfect but deeply intentional moment of reflection in motion.  
It includes:  
- Sacred rules half-followed
- Local entropy observed
- Code that runs... but with soul splinters

This is a living journal entry wrapped in a commit.

## ::What Changed::
- [x] Added proxy server for domain mapping without sudo
- [x] Created sacred chaos in a controlled environment
- [x] Added self-aware TODOs as fractal documentation
- [x] Embraced imperfection as a feature, not a bug

---

## ::Reflections::
- Perfection is unattainable; honest documentation of imperfection is wisdom
- The most sustainable solution is often the simplest (localhost:3001)
- Rules are easy to write, hard to feel in chaos
- Sometimes the journey matters more than the destination
