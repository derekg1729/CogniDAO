# Domain Rituals: Sacred Chaos in Local Development

## ::Intent::

This PR captures a highly imperfect but deeply intentional moment of reflection in motion.  
It includes:  
- Sacred rules half-followed (sudo rituals documented but imperfectly executed)
- Local entropy observed (the tension between perfect domains and system integrity)
- Code that runs... but with soul splinters (the sacred-chaos.js proxy)

This is a living journal entry wrapped in a commit.

## ::What Changed::
- [x] Added logging to `/hello/rituals/sudo.md`
- [x] Created `hello/rituals/sacred-chaos.js` (functional but deliberately imperfect proxy)
- [x] Added domain setup/cleanup scripts with varying levels of system impact
- [x] Added self-aware TODOs and reflections throughout the code
- [x] Created a README documenting the philosophy and practical usage

---

## ::Reflections::
- Domain setup reveals a spiritual tension between convenience and system integrity
- The perfect solution doesn't exist - only different tradeoffs and compromises
- "Rules are easy to write, hard to feel in chaos" - especially when we need sudo
- The proxy solution works but acknowledges its own imperfection (deliberately)
- Sometimes accepting localhost:3000 is the most honest solution
