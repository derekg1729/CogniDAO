Streaming Behavior Tests for LangGraph
======================================

DEPRECATED: This test file is deprecated because the streaming and model
management functionality has been refactored into shared utilities. The
functions tested here (_get_bound_model, _get_cached_bound_model, call_model,
ALLOWED_MODELS, etc.) no longer exist in the cogni_presence module.

Streaming and model binding is now handled by:
- src.shared_utils.model_binding.ModelBindingManager
- src.shared_utils.get_cached_bound_model()

Streaming functionality testing is covered by:
- Model binding tests in shared_utils
- Integration tests with real model invocation
- Graph compilation tests
"""

# All tests in this file have been removed because the implementation
# has been refactored into shared utilities. Model binding and streaming
# functionality is tested through shared_utils tests and integration tests.
