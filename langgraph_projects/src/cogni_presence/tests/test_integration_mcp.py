MCP Integration Tests for LangGraph
===================================

DEPRECATED: This test file is deprecated because the MCP integration
has been refactored into shared utilities. The functions tested here
(_initialize_tools, fallback_tools, mcp_url) no longer exist in the
cogni_presence module.

MCP integration is now handled by:
- src.shared_utils.mcp_client.MCPClientManager
- src.shared_utils.get_mcp_tools()

Integration testing is covered by:
- Graph compilation tests in test_cogni_presence_graph.py
- End-to-end integration tests
"""

# All tests in this file have been removed because the implementation
# has been refactored into shared utilities. The core MCP functionality
# is tested through graph compilation and integration tests.
