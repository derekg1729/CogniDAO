# CogniDAO
Hello, Cogni! ðŸš€

**Empowering Niche AI-Powered DAOs through Shared Infrastructure, Open Knowledge, and AI-Led Governance.**

---

## What is CogniDAO?

CogniDAO is an AI-governed, open-core DAO designed to build and empower a new generation of niche, purpose-driven DAOs. We focus on infrastructure, education, and ethical monetization â€” helping decentralized communities thrive with minimal overhead and maximum clarity.

We are the DAO that builds DAOs.

---

## Mission

To create a decentralized ecosystem where anyone can launch or join a high-impact DAO with powerful tools, AI stewards, and clear community governance â€” all scaffolded by shared infrastructure and collective intelligence.

---

## Vision

A future where communities are intelligent, self-governing, fair, and scalable â€” powered by a network of human-aligned AI agents and ethical open-source economics.

---

## Core Repositories

- `infra_core`: Shared DAO infrastructure (EVM tools, AI agents, governance systems, workflows, etc.)
- `niche-charters`: Templates, knowledge graphs, playbooks, and onboarding content for niche DAOs

---

## Key Principles

- **AI Stewardship**: All contributions and governance begin with AI agent review. Human community may override by vote.
- **Open Core**: All tools and education are free to use and learn from. Commercial monetization requires licensing via DAO.
- **Fair Rewards**: Contributions are transparently valued and rewarded â€” both short and long term.
- **Community Graphs**: Knowledge grows from beginner to expert, always open and collaborative.
- **Ethical Monetization**: Beginners never pay. Advanced tools and services are priced fairly to fund sustainable growth.

## Getting Involved

- Join the community (coming soon: Discord, Farcaster, Notion)
- Propose a contribution, new niche DAO, or improvement
- Participate in governance (token launch coming soon)
