# Pull Request Review: #PR_48

## 1. Overall Summary
This PR focuses on refining prompt management within the CogniDAO ecosystem by migrating to LangChain's ChatPromptTemplate, enhancing user message handling, fixing existing bugs, and updating the relevant test suites. It includes crucial changes such as the removal of obsolete code, the introduction of necessary tests for validation, and updates to ensure successful functionality across the cogni_presence and playwright_poc systems. The architectural intent is to streamline prompt handling, making it more robust and user-centric, while ensuring that the related testing framework remains resilient.

## 2. Consistent Issues
The most notable issues from earlier commits, such as the removal of obsolete modules and the incorrect handling of user messages, have been effectively addressed in this PR. The tests have been updated to validate new behaviors introduced in the prompt templates. Additionally, the transition to a more logical and usable structure for prompt handling marks a significant improvement over past configurations. However, some minor points persist, such as the need for enhanced edge case testing and the integration of model binding, which is noted but not yet utilized.

## 3. Recommendations for Improvement
- **Testing Coverage**: While tests have been significantly improved, I recommend extending coverage for edge cases, particularly regarding how user messages are processed and ensuring that prompts fully integrate into existing workflows.
- **Documentation**: Updated documentation regarding changes in prompt structure and the migration to LangChain would aid future development efforts and onboarding of new contributors.
- **Action Plan for TODOs**: Addressing the TODO related to model binding in future iterations could further streamline functionality and enhance the flexibility of the system.

## 4. Final Decision
**APPROVE** - The final state of the PR demonstrates clear improvements in code quality, functionality, and direct alignment with project goals. Despite some unresolved minor points, the overall enhancements and rigorous testing make it suitable for integration into the main branch.

### Commit e1e5c76: Migrate from Jinja2 to LangChain ChatPromptTemplate with bug fix

- Move agent prompts to local prompts.py files (playwright_poc/, cogni_presence/)
- Extract generate_tool_specs_from_mcp_tools to shared_utils/tool_specs.py
- Update agents to use ChatPromptTemplate.partial() for static values
- Fix INVALID_PROMPT_INPUT bug by removing unused {task_context} placeholders
- Deprecate shared_utils/prompt_templates.py with warning messages
- Enable proper LangGraph integration with template chaining

This resolves the KeyError when LangGraph passes ['messages', 'is_last_step', 'remaining_steps']
but templates expected 'task_context'. Now templates work correctly with .partial().
