### Overall Summary
This PR addresses the simplification of the agent architecture within the CogniDAO project by integrating LangGraph's `create_react_agent`. It condenses the agent logic, enhances tool management via a centralized tool registry, and introduces lazy loading for resource optimization. Key components affected include `agent.py`, `graph.py`, and `tool_registry.py`, all of which now reflect an improved and more maintainable architecture with better performance.

### Consistent Issues
While earlier commits raised concerns about global state management and potential complexities in the new tool registry, the final implementation has streamlined these aspects significantly. The transition to using `create_react_agent` also resolves previously cumbersome manual fetching logic, allowing for cleaner and more efficient agent operations.

### Recommendations for Improvement
To further strengthen this PR, I recommend:
- Adding comprehensive unit tests for the new tool registry and agent integrations to ensure robustness under various conditions and prevent regressions in functionality.
- Considering encapsulation of global variables to avoid potential issues with shared state in concurrent environments.

### Final Decision
**APPROVE**  
This PR represents a strong step towards a more maintainable and efficient codebase. The changes are in alignment with project goals, demonstrating iterative improvement and responsiveness to previous feedback. The introduction of better architectural patterns and performance enhancements outweighs the concerns raised in individual commits.

### Commit af76dbf: Implement lazy initialization for MCP tools to fix per-turn connection overhead

- Add get_runtime_tools() function with global variable pattern
- Initialize MCP connection once per process instead of per agent step
- Apply to both playwright_poc and cogni_presence implementations
- Eliminates 100-200ms latency from repeated tool fetching
- Maintains existing error handling and retry logic

### Commit ce71c78: Simplify agent architecture using LangGraph's create_react_agent

- Replace custom agent+tool workflow with langgraph.prebuilt.create_react_agent
- Eliminate manual tool calling logic - handled by prebuilt agent internally
- Reduce agent.py files from ~65 lines to ~35 lines each
- Remove ToolNode and conditional edges from graph.py files
- Fix create_react_agent API: use model/prompt parameters correctly
- Restore should_continue functions for __init__.py compatibility

Tool registry improvements:
- Replace manual dict+lock with @alru_cache for race-safe caching
- Add async-lru dependency for robust concurrent call deduplication
- Reduce tool_registry.py from 30 to 18 lines

The core simplification: agents now return prebuilt graphs instead of
implementing custom agent-action-agent workflows.
