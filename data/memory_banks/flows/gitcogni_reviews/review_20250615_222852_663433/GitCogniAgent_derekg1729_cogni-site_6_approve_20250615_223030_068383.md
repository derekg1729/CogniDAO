### Overall Summary

This pull request marks a substantial enhancement to the Cogni-site project by introducing comprehensive support for Dolt branch management, improving API interactions, and refining the frontend to accommodate dynamic branch-specific content. The integration of the `BranchSelector` component and branch-aware hooks illustrates a clear architectural intent to make the application capable of handling multi-branch scenarios, crucial for future scalability and user-specific data views. The adjustments enhance the frontend's adaptability and backend's robustness, catering to a more modular and responsive system design.

### Consistent Issues

There were no significant persistent issues found in the final evaluation of this PR. Most concerns raised in the individual commits, such as potential type safety issues with the use of `unknown` types and error handling strategies, appear to have been addressed in subsequent commits. The iterative refinements and inclusion of comprehensive testing mitigated earlier shortcomings effectively.

### Recommendations for Improvement

1. **Enhanced Testing:** While tests were added, further augmenting the testing suite to cover edge cases, especially those involving branch transitions and error handling, would fortify the system's robustness.
   
2. **Type Safeguarding:** Despite improvements, continuously enhancing the TypeScript usage to ensure type safety, especially in dynamic data handling areas, can prevent potential runtime errors.

3. **Code Simplification:** Some parts of the implementation may benefit from simplification or refactoring to improve readability and maintainability, especially in complex functional components.

4. **Performance Evaluation:** With the addition of branch-specific functionality, assessing and optimizing the performance to handle potential latency or overhead in data fetching and rendering could be beneficial.

### Final Decision

**APPROVE**

The final state of this pull request aligns well with the project goals and core directives. It successfully addresses previous shortcomings by iteratively refining the functionality through successive commits. The PR significantly advances the application’s capabilities in handling branch-specific data, which is crucial for supporting a multi-faceted viewing and interaction experience within the Cogni ecosystem. The code in its final form is clean, well-documented, and adheres to best practices in software development, warranting approval.

### Commit 1dc00bf: gen types from preview deployment. Updated metadata types
**Review Summary**

1. **Code Quality and Simplicity:** 
   - Generally good. Changes in metadata schemas (`bug.ts`, `epic.ts`, etc.) are consistent, suggesting a systematic update.
   - Code remains clean despite numerous file modifications.

2. **Alignment with Commit Message:**
   - Partial. The commit message mentions "Updated metadata types," which aligns with the changes. However, "gen types from preview deployment" could be clearer as it's not evident how these changes relate to a deployment without broader context.

3. **Potential Issues:**
   - Introduction of `ordering: z.union([z.unknown(), z.null()]).optional()` in multiple files might introduce unpredictability due to the use of `z.unknown()`.

4. **Improvements:**
   - Clarify commit messages, especially relating to how changes link to deployment states.
   - Consider defining more explicit types instead of `z.unknown()` for better type safety and predictability.

5. **Rating:** ⭐⭐⭐★☆ (3.5/5)

*The commit demonstrates good coding practices but improvement in clarity and type safety could enhance reliability.*

**Review Summary**

1. **Code Quality and Simplicity:** 
   - High-quality updates with well-defined new models (`branchesResponse`, `branchesResponseBranchesItem`) and parameters added to existing endpoint models.

2. **Alignment with Commit Message:**
   - Excellent. The commit message details new functionality which matches the files and code changes listed, including branch support and updated API clients.

3. **Potential Issues:**
