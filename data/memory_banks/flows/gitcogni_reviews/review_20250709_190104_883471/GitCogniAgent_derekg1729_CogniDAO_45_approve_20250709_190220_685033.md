### Final Verdict on #PR_45

1. **Overall Summary**  
   This PR aims to enhance the prompt template system within the CogniDAO framework, introducing dynamic template capabilities through Jinja2 integration for the `cogni_presence` agent. It includes the establishment of comprehensive test coverage, refinements to testing configurations, and increased clarity in documentation for future contributors. Key components affected include the template management system, testing environment configurations, and existing mocking strategies in the Python testing framework.

2. **Consistent Issues (if any)**  
   While there were initial import errors and issues related to the interaction of various testing configurations, these concerns have been addressed through subsequent commits. However, the potential fragility of the global MySQL mocking remains a consideration; further scrutiny in future tests could be warranted.

3. **Recommendations for Improvement**  
   - Enhance the documentation with examples of best practices for writing tests and using the new template system to support new contributors effectively.
   - Evaluate the continued dependency on global mocks and consider alternative strategies for isolation to manage dependencies effectively.

4. **Final Decision**  
   **APPROVE**  
   The final state of the PR reflects significant improvements in clarity, functionality, and robustness. Issues present in earlier commits have been effectively resolved, aligning well with the project's goals and maintaining long-term maintainability.

### Commit 5d04252: initial prompt tests. failed to run with import errors
### Review of Commit 5d04252

1. **Code Quality and Simplicity**: Code is well-structured with comprehensive test coverage; however, consider breaking large test functions into smaller, more focused tests.

2. **Alignment**: The commit message indicates an issue with running tests due to import errors, which aligns with the addition of test files.

3. **Potential Issues**: Import errors may stem from missing dependencies or incorrect paths; ensure proper module resolution for tests.

4. **Suggestions for Improvement**: Verify import paths and dependencies. Adding `pytest` command output in the commit message could provide additional context for failures.

5. **Rating**: â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜†â˜† (3/5) â€“ Good testing effort; needs resolution of import issues.

### Commit 1e333ab: tests still failing... bug bug created: b9cf5b7c-bca1-4830-824e-3dbe36114909
### Review of Commit 1e333ab

1. **Code Quality and Simplicity**: Code modifications maintain clarity, but the addition of environment variable configurations in multiple places may lead to duplication.

2. **Alignment**: The commit message clearly indicates ongoing testing issues, aligning well with the context of changes.

3. **Potential Issues**: Continuing test failures may indicate deeper bugs or misconfigurations, especially regarding the newly added dependencies.

4. **Suggestions for Improvement**: Consolidate environment setup into a single configuration file to reduce redundancy and improve maintainability.

5. **Rating**: â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜†â˜† (3/5) â€“ Progress is made, but the underlying bugs need addressing for completion.

### Commit 4407a50: test WIP: graphs + shared utils run successfully... but others are failing. probably root conftest change
### Review of Commit 4407a50

1. **Code Quality and Simplicity**: Code modifications reflect solid practices; however, removing the shared test configuration may increase redundancy.

2. **Alignment**: The commit message indicates partial progress in testing with a potential root cause identified, aligning well with the changes made.

3. **Potential Issues**: Failure in other tests due to the root changes should be investigated further; ensure all dependencies are correctly set up.

4. **Suggestions for Improvement**: Reintroduce a simplified shared test configuration to maintain consistent setup across tests.

5. **Rating**: â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜† (4/5) â€“ Effective improvements, but re-evaluating test configurations is necessary for consistency.

### Commit 316c888: fix: restore global MySQL mocking while preserving test isolation

- Revert conftest.py to use global autouse fixtures (preserves existing functionality)
- Add conditional import for infra_core modules to handle environments without it
- Update shared_utils tox env to install mysql-connector-python directly
- Maintain backward compatibility while solving dependency isolation issue

Previous marker-based approach broke infra_core tests that relied on global mocking.
This solution maintains the working system while enabling prompt template tests.

All test environments now pass:
- graphs: 21 passed, 2 skipped
- shared_utils: 14 passed
- infra_core: 533 passed, 80 skipped, 30 xfailed, 10 xpassed
