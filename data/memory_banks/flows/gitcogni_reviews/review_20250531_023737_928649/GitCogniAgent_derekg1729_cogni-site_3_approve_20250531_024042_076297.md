### Commit e30b087: Refactor: Standardize title usage across components

Leverages the newly standardized block.metadata.title field provided by the backend.

This commit simplifies title extraction logic in:
- MemoryBlockListItem
- WorkItemRenderer
- WorkItemSidePanel
- workItemUtils (getWorkItemTitle)

All components now primarily rely on block.metadata.title. Fallbacks are in place for cases where the title might be missing or empty, defaulting to Untitled [Type]. This makes the title handling more consistent and robust.

**1. Code Quality and Simplicity:**
   - The refactor effectively simplifies title handling across multiple components, enhancing code simplicity and maintainability. Usage of `block.metadata.title` is consistent and logically implemented.

**2. Alignment with Commit Message:**
   - The changes precisely match the commit message, focusing on standardizing title usage according to new backend specifications.

**3. Potential Issues:**
   - Minimal risk, though fallback strategies may need verification to handle any unexpected `null` or `undefined` values reliably.

**4. Suggestions for Improvement:**
   - Ensure robust unit tests cover the new fallback mechanisms.
   - Consider further extraction of similar functionalities into utilities to avoid redundancy.

**5. Rating:**
   - 5/5 Stars. Commit effectively addresses consistency issues with a clean implementation, improving both functionality and code cleanliness.
