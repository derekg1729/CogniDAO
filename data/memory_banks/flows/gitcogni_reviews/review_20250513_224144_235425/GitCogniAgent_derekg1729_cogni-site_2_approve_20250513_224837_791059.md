### Commit e16da01: feat: Implement dynamic block renderer registry (stubs)

Implements the foundational system for dynamically loading block renderer
components based on block type and version. The renderers themselves
are currently auto-generated stubs and will require individual
implementation.

Key changes:
- Updates  to:
    - Generate placeholder renderer stubs into .
    - Generate a manifest file  mapping renderer keys (e.g., Task_v2) to their relative import paths.
- Creates  which:
    - Uses  to load renderers based on the generated manifest.
    - Provides a  function.
    - Includes a fallback  component for missing/unsupported types.
- Moves existing renderer stubs to the new  directory.
- Updates the corresponding task in .

This replaces the need for manual imports and allows the UI to automatically
support new block types/versions added to the backend schema index after
running the generation scripts. Adapts the initial plan from Vite's
 to Next.js's .

Note: All block renderer components are currently placeholders and
require further development to implement actual rendering logic.
