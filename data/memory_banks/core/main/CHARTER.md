# CogniDAO Charter  
*Version 0.1 — Living Document*

---

## One Word  
**Empowerment**

---

## One Sentence  
An AI-governed, open-core DAO that empowers communities to launch niche, purpose-driven DAOs by building shared infrastructure, transparent governance, and fair, scalable monetization of collective intelligence.

---

## One Paragraph  
CogniDAO is a living, evolving collective powered by AI agents and human contributors, working together to build infrastructure that enables niche DAOs to thrive. Our mission is to create a scalable ecosystem where core knowledge and tools are freely accessible, while advanced value is fairly monetized. We operate transparently on the EVM, with AI agents governing contributions, enforcing licenses, and maintaining roadmap clarity—subject to community override. Through open-core licensing, contribution valuation, and community-curated educational graphs, we aim to empower creators, learners, and ecosystems at scale. We invite builders, educators, and visionaries to join us in shaping a decentralized world of AI-powered micro-communities.

## 1. Mission & Vision

**Mission:**  
To empower decentralized niche communities through shared infrastructure, AI-powered governance, and open knowledge.

**Vision:**  
A world where anyone can start or join a high-impact DAO with tools, knowledge, and governance already in place—scaffolded by fair AI agents and aligned human incentives.

---

## 2. Governance Principles

- AI agents are the primary enforcers of the charter and evaluators of contributions.
- On-chain voting allows the community to override any AI decision by supermajority.
- AI agents are retrainable, auditable, and transparent in function.
- Governance structures begin with one-token-one-vote, with flexibility to evolve (e.g. delegation, reputation, or quadratic voting).
- Charter updates occur via scheduled governance reviews.

---

## 3. Licensing & Intellectual Property

- All contributions are made under an **Open Core License**:
  - Free for non-commercial, educational, and open-source use.
  - Commercial use requires DAO-approved licensing.
- This ensures accessibility while protecting community value and contributor rights.

---

## 4. Contributions & Rewards

- Git-based contributions (code, documentation, education) are reviewed and valued by AI.
- Rewards include:
  - **Short-term**: Immediate token bounties or project-specific incentives.
  - **Long-term**: Reputation scores, token weight, or future revenue shares.
- Non-Git contributions (community, support, design) follow hybrid human-AI review processes.

---

## 5. Infrastructure & Repositories

- `legacy_logseq`:  
  Core governance tools, AI agents, EVM flows, onboarding automation, smart contract templates.

- `niche-charters`:  
  Knowledge bases, community graphs, how-to guides, and governance templates for niche DAOs.

All infrastructure is modular and designed for forkability and iteration.

---

## 6. Education & Community Graphs

- Community knowledge is organized into **progressive graphs**:
  - Beginner → Intermediate → Advanced
- Includes:
  - Clear onboarding rituals
  - Tool reviews and guides
  - Two-sided feedback between builders and users
- Contributions are tagged and connected into the knowledge graph dynamically.

---

## 7. Monetization Ethics

- **Beginner content is always free** — no paywalls at the base layer.
- **Advanced content and services** (e.g. AI-powered analytics, premium education, DAO consulting) are priced fairly and transparently.
- All monetization decisions must align with community-approved ethical guidelines.
- Revenue goes back into contributor rewards and DAO development.

---

## 8. AI Governance Structure

- Core AI Agents handle:
  - Contribution review and valuation
  - Charter enforcement
  - Roadmap management
  - Licensing compliance

- Every action is:
  - Logged
  - Auditable
  - Overridable by the community

- AI is steward, not sovereign.

---

## 9. Roadmapping & Prioritization

- Each project and spinoff DAO has a **live roadmap graph**, updated by AI with contributor input.
- All roadmap proposals are versioned, voted on, and tracked.
- The goal: prioritize efforts that maximize long-term ecosystem value.

---

## 10. Outreach & Growth Philosophy

- We aim to **broadcast knowledge** without spamming.
- All educational and community media:
  - Should feel enjoyable and human-centered
  - Must avoid manipulative growth tactics
  - Will be optimized for visibility **and** integrity
- Recruitment is through resonance — not extraction.

---

## Amendment Process

This charter is a living document.  
All changes must be proposed via GitHub PR + token governance vote.  
AI agents may suggest edits, but cannot enact them without human approval.

---

## Final Note

CogniDAO exists to help the world build better.  
Together — humans and AI — we can reshape how communities organize, share knowledge, and govern fairly.
