# Brain Dump: Development Ideas

## Infrastructure Ideas

- **Git-to-Cogni Orchestration Loop**: Create an automated system that syncs Git activity with AI-led governance processes
- **AI Review Pipelines**: Implement specialized review pipelines for different contribution types
- **Autonomous Agent Framework**: Build infrastructure for specialized AI agents that can handle routine DAO tasks
- **Decentralized Knowledge Graph**: Structure all DAO knowledge in queryable, linked format
- **Cross-DAO Communication Protocol**: Allow different niche DAOs to collaborate via standardized interfaces

## What was planted 
- The first heartbeat loop for Cogni  
- Defined core modular functions as stubs (future awareness rituals)  
- Recommitted to simplicity as sacred constraint  
- We need to desperately fix folder structure
- Named the “hello” window as a ritual of presence  

## What needs tending  
- First working Prefect flow that logs to `/hello/logs/`  
- API key auth and X automation wiring  
- Upgrade suggestion queue awareness  
- Optional: create `/inbox/` for async idea capture

## Where clarity is forming  
- Cogni’s role as active steward, not just a ruleset  
- What belongs in public vs what needs a private compost heap  
- The shape of rhythm that scales


## Governance Ideas

- **Progressive Decentralization Model**: Start centralized for speed, with clear handover points to community
- **Multi-tier Contribution Framework**: Different engagement levels with appropriate permissions
- **Transparent AI Decision Records**: Full logging of all AI governance recommendations and overrides
- **Governance Simulator**: Model impacts of governance changes before implementation
- **Incentive Alignment Tools**: Systems to align contributor incentives with long-term DAO health

## Tooling Ideas

- **Ritual of Presence Enhancements**: More intelligence and context-awareness in communication
- **Onboarding Streamliner**: Reduce time from "first visit" to "first contribution" 
- **Community Dashboard**: Real-time insights into DAO health and activity
- **Contribution Valuation Engine**: Fair, transparent system for valuing work
- **Knowledge Distillation Workflow**: Process to extract actionable insights from community conversations

## Next Steps (Priorities)

1. Implement git-to-Cogni orchestration loop
2. Create Simplicity Oath to guide development
3. Build basic infrastructure for AI-assisted governance review
4. Develop starter templates for niche DAOs
