# Task: Improve GitCogni Test Coverage
:type: Task
:status: todo
:project: [[project-git-cogni-agent]]
:owner:

## Description
Expand test coverage for GitCogni components to address the consistent issue identified in the PR #4 self-review.

## Action Items
- [ ] Add tests for OpenAI integration components
- [ ] Add tests for CLI functionality
- [ ] Implement mocking for GitHub API calls in tests
- [ ] Add integration tests for end-to-end flow
- [ ] Create CI pipeline for automated test execution

## Notes
The GitCogni self-review of PR #4 identified "lack of corresponding tests" as a consistent issue across multiple commits. This violates the core directive that untested code is untrusted code.

Key areas requiring test coverage:
1. The OpenAI integration for both commit reviews and final verdict
2. CLI tool functionality and error handling
3. File formatting and storage mechanisms
4. Error handling for GitHub API interactions

## Estimated Effort
- Hours: 4-6 (estimated)

## Dependencies
- Completed GitCogniAgent implementation (✓)
- Completed Prefect flow (✓)
- Python testing framework setup (pytest)
