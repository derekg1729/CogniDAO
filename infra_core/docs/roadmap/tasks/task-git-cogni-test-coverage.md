# Task: Improve GitCogni Test Coverage
:type: Task
:status: completed

## Description
Expand test coverage for GitCogni components to address the consistent issue identified in the PR #4 self-review.

## Action Items
- [x] Add tests for OpenAI integration components
- [x] Add tests for CLI functionality
- [x] Implement mocking for GitHub API calls in tests
- [x] Add integration tests for end-to-end flow
- [x] Add tests for Prefect execution compatibility
- [ ] Create CI pipeline for automated test execution

## Notes
The GitCogni self-review of #PR_4 identified "lack of corresponding tests" as a consistent issue across multiple commits. This violates the core directive that untested code is untrusted code.

Key areas requiring test coverage:
1. The OpenAI integration for both commit reviews and final verdict - ✅ Added in test_git_cogni_openai.py
2. CLI tool functionality and error handling - ✅ Fixed and improved in test_git_cogni_cli.py
3. File formatting and storage mechanisms - ✅ Added in test_git_cogni_file_management.py
4. Error handling for GitHub API interactions - ✅ Added in test_git_cogni_github.py
5. End-to-end integration testing - ✅ Added in tests/integration/test_gitcogni_e2e.py
6. Prefect execution environment compatibility - ✅ Added in tests/test_prefect_imports.py

Progress update:
- Added test files: 
  - tests/agents/test_git_cogni_openai.py - Testing OpenAI integration
  - tests/agents/test_git_cogni_pr_data.py - Testing PR data processing
  - tests/agents/test_git_cogni_github.py - Testing GitHub API integration
  - tests/agents/test_git_cogni_file_management.py - Testing file management
  - tests/integration/test_gitcogni_e2e.py - End-to-end integration test with mocked GitHub API
  - tests/test_prefect_imports.py - Testing import compatibility for Prefect execution
- Current test coverage:
  - infra_core/cogni_agents/git_cogni/git_cogni.py: 85% covered
  - infra_core/cogni_agents/git_cogni/cli.py: 96% covered
  - Total: 86% coverage
- All tests now passing!

The core objective of improving test coverage has been met with 86% coverage achieved. The remaining CI pipeline setup can be implemented as a separate follow-up task.

## Estimated Effort
- Hours: 4-6 (estimated)

## Dependencies
- Completed GitCogniAgent implementation (✓)
- Completed Prefect flow (✓)
- Python testing framework setup (pytest)
