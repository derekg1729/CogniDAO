# Task: Implement LangChain Integration for GitCogni
:type: Task
:status: in_progress
:project: [[project-git-cogni-agent]]
:owner:

## Description
Create Git-specific LangChain prompts and output parsers for commit review.

## Action Items
- [ ] Adapt specialized commit review prompt (ai-review-process.v1.1.md) template with git-specific context
- [ ] Create structured output schema for review results (summary, issues, suggestions)
- [ ] Implement custom output parser for standardized review format
- [ ] Create final summarization chain for PR review decision

## Notes
For the initial MVP, we are considering two approaches:

1. **Direct OpenAI Integration**: A simpler approach that would directly call the OpenAI API with properly formatted prompts containing PR data and spirit context.

2. **Full LangChain Integration**: The more robust but complex approach described in the action items.

The focus is on crafting git-specific prompts that will enable effective code review by the LLM. Output formats will be standardized to ensure consistent, structured feedback across commits.

## Estimated Effort
- Hours: 3 (estimated)
- Hours: 1-2 (for direct OpenAI integration MVP alternative)

## Dependencies
- Python environment with required packages installed
- Completed spirit guide implementation (âœ“)
