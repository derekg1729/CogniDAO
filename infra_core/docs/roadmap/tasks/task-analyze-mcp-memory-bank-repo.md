# Task: Analyze memory-bank-mcp Repository Design
:type: Task
:status: completed
:project: [[project-langchain-memory-integration]]

## Current Status
This task involves analyzing the `alioshr/memory-bank-mcp` TypeScript repository ([https://github.com/alioshr/memory-bank-mcp](https://github.com/alioshr/memory-bank-mcp)) to understand its design patterns, file structure, and core logic. The findings will inform the Python implementation of `CogniMemoryBank`.

The analysis is complete. Findings are summarized below and will be used to implement the `CogniMemoryBank` in Python.

## Findings Summary
- **Structure**: Uses `root_dir / project_name / file_name`. The `project_name` directory holds all context files.
- **File I/O**: Core library (`FsFileRepository`, `FsProjectRepository`) provides basic file/directory operations (read, write, list, ensure exists). Treats file content generically as strings.
- **Formats & Filenames**: The library *does not* enforce specific filenames (e.g., `history.json`, `decisions.jsonl`) or formats (JSON, JSONL, TXT). The calling application is responsible for choosing filenames and providing pre-formatted content strings (e.g., JSON-stringified data, lines for JSONL).
- **Implication**: Our `CogniMemoryBank` needs to implement the logic for specific filenames (`history.json`, `decisions.jsonl`, `progress.json`, etc.) and their corresponding serialization (JSON dump, JSONL line formatting) based on the observed patterns, rather than relying on the MCP library itself for this.

## Action Items
- [x] Clone the `memory-bank-mcp` repository locally.
- [x] Analyze the `src` directory structure and overall project organization.
- [x] Identify key TypeScript classes, interfaces, and functions related to:
  - Project/session management and isolation.
  - File reading/writing (specifically Markdown and JSON formats).
  - Context management (how context is built, stored, and retrieved).
  - State/progress tracking within a session.
  - Error handling and validation.
- [x] Document the core data structures and expected file/directory layouts (e.g., how projects, sessions, contexts, logs are stored on disk).
- [x] List the essential methods and logical steps to replicate in the Python `CogniMemoryBank` class (e.g., `write_context`, `log_decision`, `update_progress`, session initialization/switching).

## Test Criteria
- [x] A summary document or notes detailing the analysis findings is created. (This section serves as the summary).
- [x] A clear list of core methods, data structures, and file layout patterns from `memory-bank-mcp` is produced to guide the Python implementation. (Summarized in Findings).
