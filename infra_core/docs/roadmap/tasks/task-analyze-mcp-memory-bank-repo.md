# Task: Analyze memory-bank-mcp Repository Design
:type: Task
:status: todo
:project: [[project-langchain-memory-integration]]

## Current Status
This task involves analyzing the `alioshr/memory-bank-mcp` TypeScript repository ([https://github.com/alioshr/memory-bank-mcp](https://github.com/alioshr/memory-bank-mcp)) to understand its design patterns, file structure, and core logic. The findings will inform the Python implementation of `CogniMemoryBank`.

## Action Items
- [ ] Clone the `memory-bank-mcp` repository locally.
- [ ] Analyze the `src` directory structure and overall project organization.
- [ ] Identify key TypeScript classes, interfaces, and functions related to:
  - Project/session management and isolation.
  - File reading/writing (specifically Markdown and JSON formats).
  - Context management (how context is built, stored, and retrieved).
  - State/progress tracking within a session.
  - Error handling and validation.
- [ ] Document the core data structures and expected file/directory layouts (e.g., how projects, sessions, contexts, logs are stored on disk).
- [ ] List the essential methods and logical steps to replicate in the Python `CogniMemoryBank` class (e.g., `write_context`, `log_decision`, `update_progress`, session initialization/switching).

## Test Criteria
- [ ] A summary document or notes detailing the analysis findings is created.
- [ ] A clear list of core methods, data structures, and file layout patterns from `memory-bank-mcp` is produced to guide the Python implementation.
