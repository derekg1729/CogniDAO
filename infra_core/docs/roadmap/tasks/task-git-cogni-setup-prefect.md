# Task: Setup Prefect Orchestration for GitCogni
:type: Task
:status: completed
:project: [[project-git-cogni-agent]]

- ## Description
  Set up Prefect workflow orchestration for the GitCogni agent using established Cogni patterns.
- ## Action Items
- [x] Create GitCogni Prefect flow leveraging existing task structure
- [x] Use the existing Prefect deployment practices (local storage)
- [x] Set up appropriate flow concurrency controls and retries
- [x] Implement PR parameter handling for branch selection
- ## Notes
  We've successfully implemented the GitCogni Prefect flow with proper PR URL parsing, branch extraction, and commit metadata retrieval. The flow successfully processes PR data and loads the required context. Flow concurrency is managed through Prefect's default mechanisms.
- ## Estimated Effort
- Hours: 4 (actual)
- ## Dependencies
- Python environment with Prefect installed
