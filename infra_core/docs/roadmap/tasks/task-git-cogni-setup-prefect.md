# Task: Setup Prefect Orchestration for GitCogni
:type: Task
:status: completed
:project: [[project-git-cogni-agent]]
:owner:
- ## Description
  Set up Prefect workflow orchestration for the GitCogni agent using established Cogni patterns.
- ## Action Items
- [x] Create GitCogni Prefect flow leveraging existing task structure
- [x] Use the existing Prefect deployment practices (local storage)
- [x] Set up appropriate flow concurrency controls and retries
- [x] Implement PR parameter handling for branch selection
- [x] Fix import path issues for proper Prefect execution
- ## Notes
  We've successfully implemented the GitCogni Prefect flow with proper PR URL parsing, branch extraction, and commit metadata retrieval. The flow successfully processes PR data and loads the required context. Flow concurrency is managed through Prefect's default mechanisms.
  
  Updated with fix for Python import paths: Modified gitcogni_flow.py to use absolute imports and add project root to path, ensuring compatibility with Prefect's execution environment. Added prefect.yaml with set_working_directory to properly set root context.
- ## Estimated Effort
- Hours: 5 (actual)
- ## Dependencies
- Python environment with Prefect installed
