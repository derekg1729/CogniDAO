# Task: Implement Direct OpenAI Integration for GitCogni MVP
:type: Task
:status: completed
:project: [[project-git-cogni-agent]]
:owner:

## Description
Create a direct OpenAI integration for the GitCogni MVP to review pull requests.

## Action Items
- [x] Create new task function to call OpenAI API
- [x] Design prompt template combining PR data and spirit context
- [x] Implement response handling and error management
- [x] Add API response to PR data structure
- [x] Test with real PR examples

## Notes
This is a simpler alternative to full LangChain integration for the initial MVP. We've implemented a staged approach:

1. Load core context and git-cogni spirit guide
2. Process each commit independently with a focused prompt
3. Combine all commit reviews into a final verdict
4. Generate both detailed and summary markdown output files

This implementation takes advantage of the existing OpenAI handler functions and provides a complete end-to-end review process. The agent successfully reviewed PR #4 (its own implementation) with detailed analysis of 22 commits and provided a comprehensive verdict with recommendations.

## Estimated Effort
- Hours: 3 (actual)

## Dependencies
- Completed commit processing (✓)
- Completed spirit guide context (✓)
- Python environment with OpenAI package installed (✓)
