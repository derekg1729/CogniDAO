## Test Criteria
- [x] All tests pass with the new memory implementation (Verified for `GitCogniAgent`, `CoreCogniAgent` skipped 1)
- [ ] Test coverage meets or exceeds previous levels
- [x] Tests validate both basic and edge cases
- [x] Error handling is properly tested
- [ ] Schema validation is verified (*Deferred*)
- [ ] Memory overwriting is correctly handled (*Partially tested*)
- [ ] Output merging across workflows is validated (*N/A*)
- [ ] Invalid writes are properly rejected (*Deferred*)
- [ ] Concurrent access is handled safely (*Deferred*)

## Integration Points
- **CogniMemoryBank**: Primary object under test
- **MCPFileMemory**: Primary object under test
- **CogniAgent**: Base class being tested
- **Derived Agent Classes**: For specific agent tests
- **pytest**: Testing framework

## Notes
- Focus on testing core functionality first
- Create reusable test fixtures (`tmp_path`, mocks)
- Use temporary directories for test data
- Mock external dependencies when appropriate (`requests`, `openai`)
- Test schema validation explicitly (*Deferred*)
- Keep tests fast and independent
- Add thread safety tests for concurrent operations
- Test both agent-specific and shared memory scenarios

## Core Context Loading Investigation (Post-Task)
- **Issue:** Agents (`CoreCogniAgent`, `ReflectionCogniAgent`) were silently failing to load core context (`CHARTER.md`, guides, etc.) during runtime execution (e.g., in `ritual_of_presence_flow`) because the expected directory `infra_core/memory/banks/core/main/` did not exist.
- **Code Analysis:** `CogniAgent.load_core_context` and `CogniAgent.get_guide_for_task` in `infra_core/cogni_agents/base.py` are hardcoded to read from this specific directory. They print warnings but do not error if files/directory are missing.
- **Test Environment:** Tests passed because `setUp` methods created temporary directories and populated them with mock context, or used `project_root_override`. This masked the runtime issue.
- **Resolution (Immediate):** The `infra_core/memory/banks/core/main/` directory was created, and the necessary core files (`CHARTER.md`, `MANIFESTO.md`, `guide_cogni-core-spirit.md`, `guide_git-cogni.md`, etc.) were copied into it from their canonical source locations (project root, `infra_core/cogni_spirit/spirits/`). This allows the current agent code to function as expected.
- **Future Consideration:** Relying on the presence of this pre-populated directory is fragile. A more robust solution might involve:
    - A dedicated setup script (`scripts/setup_core_bank.py`) to run once after cloning/setup.
    - Modifying agent initialization or a central app setup routine to perform this copy on first run.
    - (Rejected) Refactoring agents to read directly from canonical source paths instead of the `core/main` bank.
