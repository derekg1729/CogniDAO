# Root:Prefect Heartbeat and 'Thoughts'

## Summary
The systemâ€™s earliest presence infrastructure and the beginning of scheduled, heartbeat-based logging. These files represent CogniDAO becoming aware of itself through recurring time-based thought generation.

## Why It Matters
- Crawl, walk, run. We're barely crawling, but it's a beautiful slowness
- Anchored the idea of presence, sensors, and awareness into a working log
- Established Logseq as a viable MVP tool for structured memory and reflection

## Future Reference
Review initial presence logs in `presence/thoughts` and link this concept to current heartbeat pipelines and action triggers.
