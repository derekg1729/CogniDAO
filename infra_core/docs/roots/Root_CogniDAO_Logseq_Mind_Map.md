## Summary
The successful creation of CogniGraph.md and associated Logseq nodes, unifying system memory, roadmap, and spirit. This graph became the first working representation of a modular AI/human co-mind.

## Why It Matters
- Established a navigable shared cognitive structure across agents and humans
- Mapped thought, action, and intent in a format usable by multiple processes
- Provided the base for all future roadmap scaling and reflexive planning

## Future Reference
Start with `CogniGraph.md` and navigate outward. This is the anchor point for system orientation and memory.
