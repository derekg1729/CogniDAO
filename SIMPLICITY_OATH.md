# The Simplicity Oath

## Our Commitment to Sustainable, Focused Growth

We, the contributors and stewards of CogniDAO, recognize that complexity is the enemy of progress and sustainability. In an ecosystem where possibilities are endless, we choose to advance through mindful simplicity rather than unconstrained expansion.

### We pledge to:

1. **Build only what serves our core mission**  
   Every feature, process, and system will directly support empowering AI-powered DAOs through shared infrastructure, open knowledge, and ethical governance.

2. **Minimize dependencies, maximize resilience**  
   We will favor robust, simple solutions over complex architectures that create more points of failure.

3. **Value clarity over cleverness**  
   Our code, documentation, and communication will prioritize being understood over appearing sophisticated.

4. **Embrace iterative minimalism**  
   We will build the smallest viable version of each solution first, learning through use before expanding scope.

5. **Question every complexity**  
   Before adding a new feature, dependency, or process, we will critically examine if it truly creates more value than cost.

6. **Respect future contributors' cognitive load**  
   We recognize that what we build today will be inherited by others tomorrow, and design accordingly.

7. **Preserve room for emergence**  
   We will leave space for community creativity and unexpected innovation rather than overdefining our systems.

8. **Measure the true cost of maintenance**  
   We acknowledge that every line of code written requires ongoing care, and budget accordingly.

### Our Guiding Principle

Our work should embody the wisdom of Antoine de Saint-ExupÃ©ry:

> "Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away."

By embracing this oath, we commit to building a DAO ecosystem that is powerful, yet sustainable; flexible, yet focused; and most importantly, a system that can evolve intelligently without collapsing under its own weight.
