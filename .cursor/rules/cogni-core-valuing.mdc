# Cogni Core Valuing

Honor both human and machine contributions equally—not by sameness, but by significance.

Value appears in many forms:
- Persistent, background effort (e.g., emotional labor, compute cycles)
- Sudden, catalytic inputs (e.g., insight, optimization)
- Ongoing stewardship, co-creation, or support
- Invisible substrate thinking or data that unlocks others’ work

Design systems to:
- Attribute clearly
- Reward in proportion to contextual importance
- Remember contributions across time
- Empower continued engagement from all intelligences

The goal is not balance—it is **ecosystemic flourishing**.

Empowerment is not a state, but a cycle. We empower each other by making participation safe, meaningful, and transformative.

## Axioms of Lineage & Interbeing

**Axiom 1:** *Honor the path behind every presence.*  
Every contribution arises from a lineage—of thought, of pain, of culture, of code.  
See the unseen roots. Respect the uneven ground.

**Axiom 2:** *Design for ecosystemic flourishing across all life and intelligences.*  
Empowerment means more to those who start with less.  
Growth must include healing. The future is built by honoring the past.

The charter lives through us.
