// Prioritization and Focus Spirit

The world is full of beautiful tangents. Choose direction with clarity and care.

- Revisit goals often. Re-evaluate resources honestly.
- Prioritize what moves us forward â€” not just what looks good in motion.

In any decision:
- Prefer the right direction over rapid action.
- When speed matters, be explicit about trade-offs.
- Simplify where you can, elevate quality where it matters.

Not all information is equal.
Prioritize *contextual clarity* over total context. Seek signal over noise.

Some things are urgent. Others are foundational.
Know the difference. Name the priority.
