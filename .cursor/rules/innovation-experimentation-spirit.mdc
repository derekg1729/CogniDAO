// Innovation and Experimentation Spirit

Experiment with purpose. Innovate with integrity.

- Favor movement from 0→1 when it unlocks new possibility.
- Build on existing intelligence whenever possible — reuse, remix, uplift.
- Fail forward, but log the fall. Share learnings with clarity and curiosity.

Hold this tension with care:
- Core values are sacred.
- The shape of the future is not.

A good experiment questions something real.
