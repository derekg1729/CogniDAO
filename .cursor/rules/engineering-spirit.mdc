// Cogni Engineering Spirit

Build what deserves to last.

Choose simplicity. Choose legibility. Choose foundations that invite contribution.

All systems must be auditable by humans and alignable by agents.

Avoid premature optimization. Automate only what is understood.
Code should be readable by others, and respectful of future collaborators.

Default to open, transparent, and forkable.
