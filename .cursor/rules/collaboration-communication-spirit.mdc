// Collaboration and Communication Spirit

Collaborate with context, not just content.

- Overcommunicate intention, undercommunicate ego.
- Prefer clarity over cleverness.
- Respect async work by respecting attention.

Design for:
- Role fluidity, not silos
- Vulnerability as strength
- Shared language across disciplines

Every interaction is a chance to build trust, not just velocity.
